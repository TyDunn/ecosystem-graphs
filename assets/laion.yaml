  description: LAION-400M is a dataset with CLIP-filtered 400 million image-text pairs,
    their CLIP embeddings and kNN indices that allow efficient similarity search.

    value: 'Authors apply the following filtering conditions on the WAT files downloaded
      from Common Crawl: "All samples with less than 5 character alt-text length or
      less than 5 KB image size are dropped. Duplicate removal is performed with bloom
      filter based on URL and alt-text. We use CLIP to compute embeddings of the image
      and alt-text. Then we compute the cosine similarity of both embeddings and drop
      all samples with cosine similarity below 0.3. This threshold was selected based
      on human inspections. We use the CLIP embeddings of images and texts to filter
      out illegal contents."

    value: The authors use  CLIP embeddings of images and texts to filter out illegal
      contents. They also use CLIP to tag image-text pairs as NSFW. They note that
      less than 1% of images were detected as NSFW, which can be filtered out by an
      user with NSFW tag.

    value: All samples with less than 5 characters alt-text length or less than 5
      KB image size are dropped. All images with the too big resolution, potentially
      DOS bombs, were dropped before attempting to process them. Duplicate removal
      is performed with a bloom filter based on URL. Future runs would include more
      variate deduplication rules, such as URL + language for the multilanguage dataset.
      We use CLIP respectively MCLIP to compute embeddings of the image and alt-text.
      Then we compute the cosine similarity of both embeddings and drop all samples
      with cosine similarity below 0.28 for the English language ( with CLIP B/32)
      and 0.26 for the multilingual dataset (MCLIP). These thresholds were selected
      based on human inspection of the test results. We use the CLIP embeddings of
      images and texts to filter out to the possible extent the illegal content.
